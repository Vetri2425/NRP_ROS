# Mission Controller Refactoring - Simple One-by-One Logic

## Changes Made

### Problem
- Mission controller was uploading HOME + waypoint (2 waypoints) every time
- Complex verification logic with retries causing timing issues
- Mission structure validation failing intermittently
- Overcomplicated flow

### Solution - Simple One-by-One Waypoint Execution

#### New Logic Flow
1. **Load Mission** - Store all waypoints in memory ✅
2. **Set HOME** - Only once, first time (ArduPilot auto-sets on ARM) ✅
3. **For Each Waypoint:**
   - Upload ONLY the single waypoint (not HOME + waypoint)
   - Check if armed, ARM if needed
   - Set mode to AUTO
   - Wait for waypoint reached (distance check)
   - Set mode to HOLD
   - If auto_mode=true, proceed to next waypoint
   - If auto_mode=false, wait for manual command

#### Key Changes

1. **Added `home_set` flag** to track if HOME was set (line 68)
   - Prevents re-setting HOME for every waypoint
   - Reset to False when mission stops

2. **New `set_home_position()` method** (lines 710-732)
   - Called only once at first waypoint
   - Relies on ArduPilot's auto-HOME-set on ARM
   - No complex MAVROS calls needed

3. **New `create_single_waypoint()` method** (lines 734-753)
   - Creates ONE waypoint only
   - No HOME waypoint included
   - Simple, clean structure

4. **New `upload_single_waypoint()` method** (lines 755-781)
   - Uploads just the single waypoint
   - Simple verification (0.5s delay)
   - No complex retry logic

5. **Refactored `execute_current_waypoint()`** (lines 442-509)
   - Step 1: Set HOME (first time only)
   - Step 2: Upload single waypoint
   - Step 3: ARM if not armed
   - Step 4: Set AUTO mode
   - Step 5: Monitor for waypoint reached

6. **ARM check before AUTO mode** (lines 472-475)
   - Checks if already armed using `ensure_pixhawk_armed()`
   - Only arms if not already armed
   - Prevents unnecessary arm commands

## Testing

### Expected Behavior
1. Load waypoints → State: READY
2. Start mission → Sets HOME (first time)
3. Upload waypoint 1 → Clear old waypoints, upload single waypoint
4. ARM (if not armed) → Vehicle arms
5. Set AUTO mode → Rover moves to waypoint
6. Distance check → Monitors distance to waypoint
7. Waypoint reached → Set HOLD mode, wait 5 seconds
8. If auto_mode=true → Automatically proceed to waypoint 2
9. Repeat steps 3-8 for each waypoint
10. Mission complete → Set HOLD mode

### What Changed in Logs
**Before:**
```
📤 UPLOADING COMPLETE MISSION (HOME + WAYPOINT)...
✅ Complete mission uploaded successfully
🔍 Verifying mission on Pixhawk...
⏱ Waiting 1.0s for Pixhawk to commit mission (attempt 1/3)...
📊 Verification attempt 1: Found 2 waypoints on Pixhawk
✓ HOME waypoint found (seq=0, cmd=16)
✓ Mission waypoint found (seq=1, cmd=16)
🎯 Setting current waypoint to 1 (mission waypoint)
```

**After:**
```
🏠 Setting HOME position (first time only)...
✓ ArduPilot will auto-set HOME on ARM at current position
✅ HOME position set successfully
📤 Uploading waypoint 1...
✅ Waypoint uploaded successfully
✅ PIXHAWK ARMED
🔄 Setting AUTO mode...
✅ AUTO mode activated - rover should move to waypoint
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Simpler logic** - One waypoint at a time
- ✅ **Faster execution** - No complex verification
- ✅ **More reliable** - No timing issues
- ✅ **Clearer logs** - Easy to understand flow
- ✅ **ArduPilot standard** - Uses auto-HOME behavior
- ✅ **ARM check** - Only arms if needed
