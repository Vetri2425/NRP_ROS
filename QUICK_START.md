# Mission Controller - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your mission controller has been **refactored** to use simple one-by-one waypoint logic:

- ✅ **Single waypoint upload** (not HOME + waypoint)
- ✅ **HOME set once** (first time only)
- ✅ **ARM check** before AUTO mode
- ✅ **Clean 5-step flow** per waypoint

## 🚀 To Use the New Code

### 1. Restart the Service

The code is saved but needs a restart to load:

```bash
# From your terminal or via your UI
bash start_service.sh
```

### 2. Test Scripts Available

**Run the simulation** (shows expected logs):
```bash
./simulate_refactored_flow.sh
```

**Monitor real logs**:
```bash
./test_refactored_mission.sh
```

**Full end-to-end test**:
```bash
./test_mission_flow.sh
```

## 📊 New Flow (Per Waypoint)

```
1. Set HOME (first time only) → ArduPilot auto-sets
2. Upload single waypoint   → Clear + push 1 waypoint
3. ARM if not armed         → Check before AUTO
4. Set AUTO mode            → Rover moves
5. Monitor distance         → Check every 0.5s
6. Waypoint reached         → Set HOLD, wait 5s
7. Next waypoint or done    → Repeat or complete
```

## 🔍 What to Look For in Logs

### NEW (Refactored)
```
🏠 Setting HOME position (first time only)...
✓ ArduPilot will auto-set HOME on ARM
📤 Uploading waypoint 1...
🗑️ Clearing existing waypoints...
✅ Waypoint uploaded successfully
⚡ Attempting to arm Pixhawk...
✅ PIXHAWK ARMED
🔄 Setting AUTO mode...
✅ AUTO mode activated
```

### OLD (Before Refactor)
```
📤 UPLOADING COMPLETE MISSION (HOME + WAYPOINT)...
Uploading 2 waypoint(s) to Pixhawk...
  • Waypoint 0: HOME position
  • Waypoint 1: Mission target
🔍 Verifying mission on Pixhawk...
⏱ Waiting 1.0s for Pixhawk to commit mission...
```

## ⚡ Quick Test Command

```bash
# After restart, test with a single waypoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/mission/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"waypoints":[{"lat":13.072100,"lng":80.262000,"alt":10}],"auto_mode":true}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/mission/start

# Watch logs
journalctl -u nrp-service -f | grep MISSION_CONTROLLER
```
